**1.) Once we enter the End User URL for Osticket we will be brought to the front page of support center and we will click on open a new ticket from there we will put in the fake users information such as "Karen" here for instance and make up a fake scenrio and click on the appropriate help topic and submit our ticket.**

**2.) Then after that we will log into one of Agents we created in this instance "Jane Doe" and check our open Tickets!!**

**3.) Click and open a ticket for this instance I chose "Entire Mobile Banking is Down" and make sure to change SLA, Deparment and severity of the Ticket before begining to resolve the ticket.** 

**As you change the properties of the ticket it shows what changes have been made in the history thread where other agents can see.**

**4.) Now when you back out onto the Ticket list you can see how differnet the ticket looks from the others and how we changed and altered this ticket to be set to Jane Doe and priority level is high**

**5.) From here you can resolve this ticket we created by submitting a response and finally close the ticket.**

**6.) Once the ticket is resolved you can check and see it in the closed ticket tab and see more closed tickets from colleagues and get an intution on how tickets get resolved and build up the courage for yourself and just repeat the steps with the other tickets and that will be all from This osTicket project, I really learned how to go through a ticketing system from a users perspective and as a helpdesk agent.**
